        "First you will learn a few common ways to encode/embed text as vectors/matrices such that a neural network can use it as an input.\n",

        "\n",
        "As you might already have thought BoW embeddings have a few problems.\n",
        "Firstly, it diregards the order of words which, as previously stated, can be quite important.\n",
        "Secondly, the size of the embedding grows larger with the size of the vocabulary.\n",
        "While the second issue can be solved by limiting the vocabulary to the most common/important words, this remains a fairly large vector with very few non-zero elements (a sparse vector).\n",
        "\n",
        "One commonly used alternative that fixes both of these issues is the so-called Word2Vec embeddings.\n",
        "Word2Vec can be summarized as using machine learning to learn non-sparse (most, if not all, entries are non-zero) word embeddings with fewer dimensions (typically between 100 and 1000). A text is then represented as a matrix where the first row (or column depending on how you use it) represents the first word and so on.\n",
        "<img src=\"attachment:image.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
        "\n",
        "So how do you learn an embedding?\n",
        "Again, there are many ways to do this, but the most common Word2Vec methods use the idea that a word is defined by the company it keeps.\n",
        "That is, an embedding of a word is good if you can either use it to predict which the surrounding words are or if it can be predicted using the surrounding words.\n",
        "So you either train a model to predict the surrounding words from the central word, or train it to predict a word from the surrounding ones.\n",
        "These two methods are called Skip-Gram and Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) respectively and are illustrated by the images below.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h1><center>Skip-gram</center></h1>| <h2><center>CBoW</center></h2>\n",
        "- | -\n",
        "<img src=\"attachment:image-3.png\" width=\"300\"> | <img src=\"attachment:image-2.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
        "\n",
        "The logic behind these methods can be better understood by imagining synonyms.\n",
        "If we're creating embeddings (codes) to represent different words, it makes sense that similar words should have similar embeddings.\n",
        "Since synonymous words would have many similar surrounding words in many sentences, telling the difference between the two would be difficult, and thus giving them similar embeddings would lead to a lesser error.\n",
        "However, words that have slightly different meaning cannot have the same embeddings, because that would make predicting words from that embedding more difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "While training useful such embeddings for every single words takes huge datasets of texts, this only has to be done once and then those embeddings can be used for many different applications.\n",
        "Due to this time consuming training we will only train a very small sample of word embeddings to learn how it's done and better understand them.\n",
        "Afterwards we will use pretrained embeddings to do some actual prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this in mind we will use the \"cat on the mat\" dataset to train our embeddings.\n",
        "Our goal is to create embeddings where each group of words (animals, furniture, actions, and other) are given distinct groups in the encoding space."

We would thus expect king to have a presence in the \"royalty\"-axis, and in the \"man\"-axis. Removing man and adding woman should thus result in \"royalty\" + \"woman\", in other words a queen.

When using BoW, our encodings collapsed to the same dimensions, but with w2v we faced the challenge of having varying input dimensions. In RNNs, our input is fed sequentially to the network together with the previous network output. After our first input token is transformed to a prediction, this prediction is fed to the same network together with the next token, until all tokens have been seen. Thus, regardless of if our input sequence is one word or 100 words, the network size remains the same (but for 100 words we will have to backprop 100 times through the network to train it. What issues might this cause?).\n",
